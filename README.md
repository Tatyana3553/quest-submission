Chapter 1. Day 1. 

Explain in your own words what blockchain is.  Blockchain is an open, distributed, decentralized database.

 Explain what a smart contract is.
 Smart contracts are code that resides on the blockchain.  It defines what data will be stored on the chain and how it will be managed.

 Explain the difference between a script and a transaction.
 A transaction can change the data on the chain.
 The script is read-only.
 The script can be executed for free on the chain, and you need to pay to complete the transaction.

Chapter 1. Day 2. 

What are the 5 pillars of the Cadence programming language?
  1) Security and protection 2) Clarity 3) Accessibility 4) Developer experience 5) Resource-centric programming.

  In your opinion, even without knowing anything about blockchain or coding, why would the 5 pillars be useful (you don't have to answer that for #5)?
 A set of 5 pillars inspires confidence and reliability!

2. In a script, initialize a dictionary that maps the Strings Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, and LinkedIn to a UInt64 that represents the order in which you use them from most to least. For example, YouTube --> 1, Reddit --> 2, etc. If you've never used one before, map it to 0!
